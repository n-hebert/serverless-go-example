# Sample Go & Serverless

## Usage

1. Clone
2. Install [Serverless Framework](serverless.com) via npm
3. Run `npm install` in the package directory to get the plugin
3. Run `sls deploy` from within this folder

You will get an "example" Go plugin Serverless framework project.
And the junk that comes with it.

## What is this project?

I copied, updated and adapted for Canada the example files at [mthenw/serverles-go-plugin](https://github.com/mthenw/serverless-go-plugin).
